# SIMPLE STACKS CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Demonstrate basic 2-level stack hierarchy
# Complexity: Low (2 leaf stacks, 2 parent stacks)
# Use Case: Understanding how stacks work, basic testing
#
# Structure:
#   - 2 leaf stacks (frontend, backend) containing actual Terraform directories
#   - 1 parent stack (full-app) that combines both leaf stacks
#   - 1 parent stack (backend-only) that references just the backend
#
# Expected UI Behavior:
#   - Two top-level expandable cards (full-app, backend-only)
#   - full-app expands to show frontend + backend as nested cards
#   - backend-only expands to show just backend as nested card
#   - Each nested card shows dirspaces (actual Terraform directories)
# ============================================================================

stacks:
  names:
    # Leaf stacks (Level 2) - these contain actual Terraform directories
    frontend:
      tag_query: 'dir:app/frontend'

    backend:
      tag_query: 'dir:app/backend'

    # Parent stacks (Level 1) - these group leaf stacks together
    full-app:
      stacks:
        - frontend
        - backend

    backend-only:
      stacks:
        - backend
